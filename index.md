## Favourite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 2
I enjoyed working on lab two because the formatting in coding was easier to benign than it was too complicated. The code on this lab was a simple task: It was to declare a string variable. And most of the code mostly told us to just declare a string variable which is an easy task to do. A variable declared in this lab was plural_noun. I also enjoyed working with my lab partner. We worked together to sell this lab and we were able to strive through it. 

Lab 4
Working on lab 3 was fun. It was a little more difficult when formatting the code but me and my partner were able to finish it. The code was based on measurements of volume from the metric system we were supposed to code the amount of tablespoons and other measurements. At first I didn't get it but my partner guided me through it and helped me out to understand the coding formats.  I was able to do the equation for the measurements and get the right coding down. 

Lab 7
Lab 7  was a fun lab to do. It had its long process when formatting. Lab 7 was parking.cc this lab when ove the time and days a car was supposed to park in a specific street the schedule of an individual street. The code was a little complicated at first but we were able to find help and put the exact code we were asked to do. We were supposed to code  the specific days a street doesn't allow you to park and also the hours of how long you can't park there. This lab was interesting and it was fun to do.
